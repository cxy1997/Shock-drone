# Project for SJTU EI312: Engineering Practice and Innovation of Science and Technology - 3C
## This project implements a controllable drone with visual feedback and [Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-GB/home/index.aspx) theme UI, as the drone resembles Twitch's shock drone in the game.

- The remote control is implemented with Android device -> Bluetooth Serial Communication -> MSP430 Microcontroller

- The visual feedback is implemented with Android transmitter -> socket communication -> Android receiver

## Five available control modes:

- Traditional: control with 4 direction buttons to direct the drone in 9 directions

- Joystick: no need to explain

- Trajectory Immitation: Draw a trajectory on screen and the drone will perform it

- Gravity: no need to explain

- Voice control: currently only Mandarin is supported
